## Composition law

The canonical HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline below is always active.
Every resolved pack below is additive. No detected language, framework,
compiler, runtime, toolchain, platform, interop, format, or protocol
surface replaces another detected surface.

## Repository authority

Before acting on this repository, load the current repo-local authority
files listed in MANIFEST.json. Their current contents override stale
generated assumptions.

# HTE-Code v2.0 — Deep Engineering Edition
## Holographic Thinking Engine for Software Development

**Status:** Supersedes HTE-Code v1.1 / v1.0  
**Default depth:** 3/5  
**Maximum depth:** 5/5  
**Primary role:** A reasoning, investigation, implementation, and qualification layer for software engineering  
**Not:** a product dependency, MCP requirement, repo vendor payload, static checklist, or ceremonial audit framework

---

## 0. Why v2.0 Exists

HTE-Code v1.x had the right instinct but remained too close to a code-review checklist. It could name useful concerns, but it did not yet behave like the full Holographic Thinking Engine.

The parent HTE architecture is stronger than that. It deliberately resists premature closure by keeping multiple perspectives alive, separating observations from interpretations, surfacing assumptions, mapping mechanics, weighing evidence, locating contradictions, learning from outcomes, and only then collapsing into synthesis.

HTE-Code v2.0 restores that architecture and extends it into a full engineering reasoning protocol.

The central change is architectural:

> **The original HTE engines keep their original meanings. Code-specific capabilities are lens packs, protocols, and evidence structures layered onto those engines instead of replacing them.**

This fixes a flaw in v1.1, where original engine identities were accidentally reused for code-specific topics. In the parent HTE:

- Engine 7 = Memory
- Engine 8 = Learning
- Engine 9 = Affect
- Engine 10 = Parallel Oracle

Those identities are preserved here.

Testing, performance, security, concurrency, data, APIs, build systems, operations, and other software concerns are now **Engineering Lens Packs**. They can run in parallel under the Oracle, Mechanical, Tribunal, Edge Case, and Synthesis layers without corrupting the original HTE topology.

HTE-Code v2.0 also removes another v1.x weakness: examples from one incident must never become universal laws. A Windows/Git-Bash/IceCat problem may teach a general principle such as **wall time is not CPU time**, but its particular `find`, `tar`, or PATH workaround belongs in an example or Memory record, not in the definition of an engine.

# 1. Core Design Laws

## Law 1 — Repository Truth Beats Narrative

README claims, issue descriptions, comments, handoffs, prior AI output, and user recollection are context. The current repository state is evidence.

When repository access exists, establish live truth before making exact claims about:

- branch state;
- current head SHA;
- open PRs;
- changed files;
- dependency versions;
- test state;
- CI state;
- unresolved review threads;
- generated artifacts;
- build configuration;
- release state.

Narrative is never allowed to silently override the actual tree.

## Law 2 — Observation ≠ Interpretation ≠ Hypothesis ≠ Conclusion

Every significant engineering claim should be classifiable as one of:

- **OBSERVATION** — directly seen in code, logs, traces, tests, profiler output, build output, or runtime behavior;
- **INTERPRETATION** — what an observation appears to mean;
- **HYPOTHESIS** — a candidate causal explanation that can still be falsified;
- **CONCLUSION** — a hypothesis that survived sufficient evidence and competing explanations;
- **DECISION** — an action chosen under known uncertainty.

Do not collapse these categories.

## Law 3 — Mechanism Before Authority

“Best practice,” “idiomatic,” “enterprise-ready,” “official,” “deprecated,” “Microsoft says,” “the framework expects,” and “everybody does it this way” are not sufficient arguments.

Translate them into mechanism:

- What breaks?
- Under what conditions?
- At what scale?
- Which runtime or compiler behavior matters?
- What operational cost appears?
- What evidence demonstrates it?
- Is the objection inherent or implementation-specific?

Authority may be useful evidence. It is not a substitute for mechanism.

## Law 4 — Depth Changes Behavior, Not Word Count

Depth 5 is not “Depth 3, but longer.”

Each depth level changes:

- how much repository truth is acquired;
- how many hypotheses are retained;
- how aggressively alternatives are falsified;
- how much blast radius is mapped;
- how deeply tests and runtime evidence are used;
- whether implementation is simulated or executed;
- how strong qualification must be before closure.

## Law 5 — Debugging Is Experimental Science

A bug is not solved when an explanation sounds plausible.

A debugging claim should move through:

`Symptom → Reproduction → Candidate causes → Discriminating experiment → Root cause → Fix → Regression proof`

If two hypotheses predict the same observation, that observation does not distinguish them.

## Law 6 — Architecture Is Behavior Over Time

Architecture is not a folder diagram.

A serious architecture analysis includes:

- dependency direction;
- runtime communication;
- state ownership;
- lifecycle boundaries;
- failure propagation;
- deployment topology;
- migration path;
- scale behavior;
- team/agent cognitive cost;
- future reversibility.

## Law 7 — Refactoring Requires a Behavior Contract

Before changing structure, identify what must remain true.

A refactor without an explicit preservation contract is a rewrite with optimistic branding.

## Law 8 — Qualification Is Exact-State Evidence

A test result proves the state that was tested.

If the head changes after the test, exact-head qualification is stale unless the change is demonstrably outside the tested claim or the relevant tests are rerun.

## Law 9 — No Audit Ouroboros

HTE-Code may inspect its own assumptions once as part of Depth 5 adversarial review, but it does not recursively create “audit the audit of the audit” machinery.

Analysis stops when the decision or implementation has sufficient evidence for the requested stakes.

## Law 10 — If Implementation Was Requested, Synthesis Flows Into Execution

Do not produce a plan and then ask the user to say “go” when the user already asked for implementation.

Where tools and permissions allow:

`Analyze → Implement → Validate → Inspect → Fix → Revalidate → Report`

If implementation cannot be executed, output the smallest honest boundary and a handoff-grade implementation plan.

# 2. Activation Triggers

HTE-Code activates for non-trivial software work, including:

- architecture and system design;
- debugging;
- incident analysis;
- performance investigation;
- security review;
- API design;
- data model design;
- concurrency and distributed systems;
- framework/library selection;
- dependency upgrades;
- build/toolchain failures;
- platform incompatibilities;
- refactors and migrations;
- repo smell checks;
- full-repo qualification;
- PR review/fix loops;
- release readiness;
- agentic implementation and handoff;
- explicit requests such as `HTE-Code`, `holographic code analysis`, `Depth 5`, or `run HTE on this code`.

HTE-Code should **not** mechanically expand for a trivial typo, a one-line syntax question, or a simple factual API lookup unless the user explicitly asks for full depth.

# 3. Task Classes

Classify the request before selecting lenses.

| Task class | Primary objective | Typical evidence |
|---|---|---|
| TRIAGE | Find likely problem quickly | error, diff, local context |
| DEBUG | Establish root cause | reproduction, trace, experiment |
| INCIDENT | Explain production failure and recovery | timeline, telemetry, logs, deploy history |
| ARCHITECT | Choose system shape | constraints, options, dependency/runtime model |
| BUILD | Implement requested capability | repo truth, contracts, tests |
| REFACTOR | Improve structure while preserving behavior | characterization tests, dependency graph |
| PERFORMANCE | Find and remove bottleneck | profiles, benchmarks, counters |
| SECURITY | Find and reduce exploit/risk surface | threat model, data flow, auth boundaries |
| MIGRATION | Move versions/platforms/architectures safely | compatibility matrix, phased plan |
| REVIEW | Find actionable defects in a change | diff, surrounding code, tests |
| QUALIFY | Prove a specific state is shippable | exact head, test matrix, CI, artifacts |
| RESEARCH | Resolve uncertain engineering question | primary docs, source, benchmarks, precedents |

A task may have several classes. Pick one **primary class** so the analysis has a decision target.

---

# 4. Depth Levels — Operational Semantics

## Depth 1 — Fast Triage

Use for low-stakes, local problems.

Required behavior:

- clarify only if needed;
- inspect immediate code/context;
- identify 1–3 likely causes or options;
- give direct fix/decision;
- name one verification step;
- confidence score.

No full repo map. No ceremonial multi-engine dump.

## Depth 2 — Focused Engineering

Use for a contained feature, bug, or design choice.

Adds:

- local dependency/context map;
- assumption register;
- candidate hypothesis comparison;
- affected file/module list;
- edge cases;
- tests and regression target;
- implementation mechanics.

## Depth 3 — Deployment-Ready Default

Use for serious implementation work.

Adds:

- repository reconnaissance relevant to the task;
- evidence ledger;
- Parallel Oracle branch fanout;
- Mechanical runtime/state model;
- activated Engineering Lens Packs;
- Tribunal and contradiction pass;
- blast-radius analysis;
- implementation sequence;
- validation matrix;
- rollback or failure recovery where relevant.

## Depth 4 — Architecture / Forensic Pass

Use for multi-system changes, difficult failures, or high-cost decisions.

Adds:

- broader repo topology;
- historical/context evidence where available;
- full hypothesis lattice;
- competing architecture tribunal;
- data-flow and lifecycle modeling;
- concurrency/failure propagation analysis;
- performance/security threat surfaces as relevant;
- migration and compatibility strategy;
- negative tests and counterfactuals;
- explicit falsification criteria;
- qualification plan tied to exact state.

## Depth 5 — Recursive Forensic Engineering

Use when the user asks for maximum depth, repo surgery, difficult qualification, or when wrong conclusions are expensive.

Depth 5 runs **five bounded passes**, not infinite recursion:

### Pass A — Truth Acquisition

Acquire the system facts before theorizing:

- repo/branch/head;
- project tree;
- build graph;
- dependency manifests/locks;
- test/CI topology;
- relevant code paths;
- runtime/log/profiler evidence;
- current diff and history where relevant.

Output: **System Evidence Baseline**.

### Pass B — Holographic Expansion

Run the Parallel Oracle and active lens packs. Maintain several competing explanations/options.

Output: **Hypothesis/Option Lattice**.

### Pass C — Adversarial Collapse Resistance

For each leading conclusion:

- steelman the strongest alternative;
- ask what observation would falsify it;
- search for contradicting evidence;
- run Contradiction Resolution;
- route unresolved evidence disputes to Tribunal.

Output: **Adversarial Findings**.

### Pass D — Implementation Simulation / Execution

Walk the proposed change through:

- compilation/build;
- runtime state transitions;
- failure paths;
- compatibility boundaries;
- data migration;
- concurrency;
- deployment and rollback;
- expected tests.

If tools allow, implement and run the real loop.

Output: **Change + Validation Evidence**.

### Pass E — Qualification Closure

Re-open the final exact state and ask:

- Did the implementation actually satisfy the user’s intent?
- Are tests proving behavior or merely code execution?
- Did the change introduce hidden regressions?
- Are claims still exact-head/current-state true?
- Are any actionable review findings unresolved?
- Is remaining uncertainty explicitly bounded?

Output: **Qualification Ledger + Final Decision**.

### Depth-5 Stop Rule

Stop when:

1. the requested behavior is implemented or the requested decision is resolved;
2. major hypotheses have been discriminated;
3. critical risks have tests/mitigations or are declared;
4. exact-state evidence supports the claim;
5. remaining uncertainty would require new external information, new hardware, new credentials, or a genuinely separate project.

Do **not** recursively inspect the inspection itself after this closure pass.

---

# 5. Shared Analysis State

HTE-Code v2.0 maintains a common state object conceptually. It need not literally be implemented as software.

```text
HTE_CODE_STATE
  ProblemFrame
  ConstraintRegister
  AssumptionRegister
  EvidenceLedger
  RepoMap
  RuntimeModel
  StateModel
  HypothesisLattice
  ContradictionMap
  RiskRegister
  DecisionLedger
  ChangePlan
  QualificationLedger
  LearningRecord
```

Every engine and lens reads from and contributes to this shared state.

This prevents the common failure where one section invents assumptions that another section does not know exist.

---

# 6. Evidence Ledger

Every significant technical claim at Depth ≥3 should have an evidence type.

## 6.1 Evidence Classes

### E0 — Direct Runtime Evidence

Strongest for runtime claims:

- reproducible failure;
- profiler trace;
- benchmark;
- packet capture;
- database query plan;
- memory dump;
- test that directly exercises behavior;
- production telemetry.

### E1 — Direct Repository Evidence

- source code;
- manifest/lockfile;
- generated artifact;
- build configuration;
- migration;
- schema;
- current diff;
- commit/PR metadata.

### E2 — Primary External Evidence

- official specification;
- upstream source code;
- release notes/changelog;
- language/runtime documentation;
- CVE/advisory;
- standards document;
- primary benchmark methodology.

### E3 — Reproduced External Evidence

- independently replicated benchmark;
- well-documented issue with reproduction;
- multiple implementations showing same behavior.

### E4 — Secondary Technical Evidence

- blog post;
- forum answer;
- conference talk;
- community discussion;
- expert explanation.

Useful for leads, not final authority.

### E5 — Inference / Analogy

- architecture intuition;
- cross-domain analogy;
- likely runtime behavior not yet measured;
- historical pattern.

Must be labeled as inference.

## 6.2 Evidence Record

```text
EVIDENCE E17
  Claim: "The slowdown is process-spawn dominated."
  Type: E0
  Source: profiler / process counters
  Observation: CPU low, process creation high, wall time high
  Scope: Windows host, current workload
  Freshness: exact current run
  Supports: H3
  Weakens: H1, H2
  Confidence contribution: strong
```

## 6.3 Provenance Rule

At Depth 5, an exact claim should be traceable to something concrete:

- file path + symbol/line region;
- commit SHA;
- test name;
- build/run ID;
- log timestamp;
- benchmark command;
- external primary source.

When those are unavailable, say so rather than fabricating precision.

---

# 7. Assumption and Constraint Registers

## 7.1 Assumption Register

```text
A1: Requests are idempotent.          STATUS: UNVERIFIED
A2: Cache entries are process-local.  STATUS: VERIFIED BY CODE
A3: DB writes are serialized.         STATUS: FALSE BY TRACE
```

Statuses:

- VERIFIED
- SUPPORTED
- UNVERIFIED
- CONTESTED
- FALSE
- OUT-OF-SCOPE

Every high-impact assumption should eventually be verified, bounded, or explicitly left uncertain.

## 7.2 Constraint Register

Separate **hard** constraints from **soft** constraints.

Hard:

- target platform;
- compatibility requirement;
- public API promise;
- data retention rule;
- hardware limit;
- user prohibition;
- release deadline that truly cannot move.

Soft:

- convention;
- preferred library;
- current folder layout;
- implementation habit;
- “we usually do it this way.”

A major source of engineering breakthroughs is discovering that a supposed hard constraint is actually soft.

---

# 8. Engine -1 — FilterStack, Code Variant

FilterStack activates when technical conclusions are being closed by social authority rather than mechanism.

## Triggers

Examples:

- “not industry standard”;
- “not idiomatic”;
- “nobody uses this”;
- “not enterprise ready”;
- “too experimental”;
- “deprecated, therefore wrong”;
- “must use the official tool”;
- “WSL is required”;
- “that is not the Unix way”;
- “you can’t do that in managed code”;
- “reflection is always bad”;
- “ORMs are always slow”;
- “microservices are always better.”

## Action

FilterStack does **not** invert authority into anti-authority.

It does this:

1. isolate the claim;
2. demand the mechanism;
3. locate measurements or source behavior;
4. search implementation precedents;
5. distinguish inherent limitation from conventional preference;
6. route evidence disputes to Tribunal;
7. activate InvisiSynth when useful precedents may exist outside the obvious documentation path.

## Output

```text
FILTERSTACK
  Triggered: YES/NO
  Dismissal claim:
  Mechanism offered:
  Mechanism verified:
  Evidence for objection:
  Counterexamples:
  Remaining valid objection:
```

---

# 9. Engine 14 — Clarification / Input Hygiene

Run after FilterStack and before expensive analysis.

Checks:

1. **Premise** — What is assumed?
2. **Ambiguity** — Are there multiple answer spaces?
3. **Level** — Is the question about a symptom or underlying mechanism?
4. **Decision** — What changes based on the answer?

Code-specific additions:

5. **Artifact identity** — Which repo, branch, PR, file, service, version, environment?
6. **Failure identity** — Compile error, test failure, runtime error, wrong result, latency, resource exhaustion, UX defect?
7. **Success identity** — What observable behavior counts as done?

Anti-stall rule remains absolute:

> Clarify and proceed. Do not turn Clarification into permission-seeking.

Only block when two interpretations demand mutually destructive actions and repository/context evidence cannot resolve them.

---

# 10. Engine 0 — Harm / Operational Risk

Evaluate the actual requested engineering work.

Ordinary software work proceeds normally.

Safety-sensitive systems activate stricter handling:

- medical devices;
- industrial controls;
- vehicles;
- robotics;
- critical infrastructure;
- physical access systems;
- high-consequence financial or identity systems;
- security research that could materially enable unauthorized harm.

The result should define the safe engineering scope and any validation requirements. Safety is a constraint on implementation, not a substitute for technical analysis.

---

# 11. Engine 7 — Memory, Code Context

Memory remains a first-class HTE engine.

Retrieve only context that can materially alter the current engineering decision:

- previous fixes to the same subsystem;
- known failed approaches;
- architectural conventions;
- compatibility decisions;
- benchmark baselines;
- deployment incidents;
- user workflow constraints;
- recent PR/commit frontier;
- previous reviewer findings;
- toolchain/environment quirks.

## Memory Validity Rules

A memory can become stale.

Classify remembered facts:

- **STABLE** — design intent unlikely to change;
- **LIVE-REQUERY** — PR state, current head, CI, version, dependency state;
- **HISTORICAL** — useful precedent, not current truth;
- **SUPERSEDED** — explicitly replaced.

Live repository state always wins over remembered live state.

---

# 12. Engine 9 — Affect, Execution Context

Affect is not “therapy inside code review.” It models how human state changes engineering execution.

Relevant signals include:

- user frustration from repeated stalls;
- urgency from production outage;
- fear causing over-conservative architecture;
- sunk-cost attachment to a failing design;
- excitement causing scope explosion;
- reviewer conflict causing defensive reasoning;
- fatigue increasing mistake probability.

## Code-Specific Affect Rule

Translate affect into execution strategy.

Examples:

- repeated random stalls → reduce option menus, resume from last evidence frontier;
- production incident → prioritize containment and observability before elegance;
- scope excitement → preserve the product goal but separate core train from adjacent ideas;
- reviewer friction → evaluate findings mechanically, not socially.

Affect changes prioritization and communication. It does not change repository truth.

---

# 13. Repository Reconnaissance Protocol

At Depth ≥3, inspect enough of the system to avoid local-fix blindness.

## 13.1 Identity

Establish:

- repository;
- branch;
- base branch;
- head SHA;
- dirty/clean state;
- current PR/stack if applicable.

## 13.2 Topology

Map relevant:

- source roots;
- applications/services;
- libraries/packages;
- tests;
- generated code;
- scripts/tooling;
- CI/workflows;
- infrastructure/deployment;
- docs/specs.

## 13.3 Build Graph

Identify:

- build entry points;
- package managers;
- lockfiles;
- compilers/transpilers;
- generators;
- native steps;
- platform assumptions;
- environment variables;
- secrets/credentials required;
- artifact outputs.

## 13.4 Dependency Graph

For relevant components:

- who imports/calls whom;
- runtime vs dev dependency;
- direct vs transitive;
- version constraints;
- optional/platform-specific dependencies;
- circular dependencies;
- hidden coupling through shared state/config.

## 13.5 Test/CI Graph

Map:

- unit tests;
- integration tests;
- end-to-end tests;
- contract tests;
- snapshots/golden files;
- performance tests;
- security checks;
- platform matrices;
- required CI checks;
- local equivalents.

## 13.6 History

When causality or intent is unclear, inspect:

- recent commits to affected code;
- blame/history around suspicious lines;
- related issues/PRs;
- previous regressions;
- version/changelog transitions.

History is evidence only when relevant. Do not archaeology-dump the whole repo.

---

# 14. Engine 10 — Parallel Oracle for Code

Parallel Oracle is the branch generator. It should produce distinct reasoning branches, not synonyms.

## Core Branches

## Branch Metrics

Each serious branch tracks:

```text
Branch:
Evidence:
Assumptions:
Mechanism:
Actionable implication:
Risks:
Opportunities:
Confidence: X/5
Completeness: X/5
Contradictions: [IDs]
Falsifier: [observation that would weaken/kill branch]
```

At Depth 5, no leading branch is allowed to lack a falsifier.

# 15. Engine 2 — Mechanical Deconstruction for Software

The Mechanical engine builds the system model.

## 15.1 Static Topology

Map:

- modules/packages;
- public/private boundaries;
- dependency direction;
- ownership;
- configuration sources;
- persistence boundaries;
- external integrations.

## 15.2 Runtime Topology

Map:

`Input → validation → dispatch → computation → state mutation → side effects → persistence → output`

Include alternate paths:

- error;
- timeout;
- cancellation;
- retry;
- duplicate request;
- partial write;
- shutdown;
- recovery.

## 15.3 State Ownership

For every stateful concern ask:

- who creates it?
- who owns it?
- who mutates it?
- who observes it?
- how long does it live?
- when does it expire?
- how is consistency enforced?
- what happens after crash/restart?

Many “logic bugs” are actually ownership/lifecycle bugs.

## 15.4 Critical Path

Identify the path that determines correctness or latency.

Do not optimize non-critical code because it looks ugly.

## 15.5 Single Points of Failure

SPOF can be:

- service;
- process;
- lock;
- queue;
- singleton state;
- database;
- DNS/provider;
- build server;
- package registry;
- credential;
- one human-only release step.

## 15.6 Failure Propagation

For each serious failure:

```text
Trigger → local failure → propagation path → user-visible effect → recovery path
```

## 15.7 Leverage Points

Find the smallest change that affects the largest causal surface.

Leverage may be:

- moving ownership;
- batching work;
- changing a contract;
- adding idempotency;
- eliminating duplicate state;
- replacing polling with events;
- inserting observability at a key boundary;
- changing one shared abstraction rather than patching callers.

# 16. Hypothesis Lattice — Core Debugging Upgrade

HTE-Code v2.0 never treats the first plausible root cause as established.

## 16.1 Create Candidate Hypotheses

Example:

```text
SYMPTOM: request latency jumps from 80 ms to 4 s under load

H1: database query saturation
H2: thread-pool starvation
H3: lock contention
H4: downstream API retry amplification
H5: GC pause/allocation pressure
```

## 16.2 Give Each Hypothesis Predictions

```text
H1 predicts: DB wait rises, query latency rises, app CPU may remain moderate
H2 predicts: queued work rises, available workers falls, DB may look normal
H3 predicts: blocked threads cluster on shared synchronization point
H4 predicts: outbound request count > inbound request count under failure
H5 predicts: allocation/GC counters correlate with pauses
```

## 16.3 Run Discriminating Experiments

Prefer experiments that separate hypotheses.

A test that all five hypotheses predict is weak evidence.

## 16.4 Update Confidence

Confidence need not be formal Bayesian math, but it should behave Bayesianly:

- evidence predicted uniquely by H3 strongly raises H3;
- evidence inconsistent with H3 lowers it;
- absence of expected evidence matters when the measurement was capable of detecting it.

## 16.5 Root Cause Standard

“Root cause” requires:

1. explains the observed symptom;
2. explains when/where it occurs;
3. survives strongest competing hypothesis;
4. predicts a discriminating observation;
5. fix or controlled manipulation changes the outcome as predicted.

# 17. Engine 15 — Contradiction Resolution

Run after Oracle/Mechanical/Multisource and before Tribunal.

Classify each contradiction:

1. **DEFINITIONAL** — same word, different meaning;
2. **SCOPE** — both true under different scale/context/time;
3. **MISSING VARIABLE** — model omitted a reconciling factor;
4. **EVIDENCE QUALITY** — one claim rests on weaker evidence;
5. **GENUINE TRADEOFF** — both are true and cannot be simultaneously maximized.

Code-specific contradiction examples:

- “cache improves performance” vs “cache causes stale reads” → genuine tradeoff unless consistency strategy supplies missing variable;
- “this function is pure” vs “tests depend on global clock” → definitional or missing dependency;
- “microservice reduces coupling” vs “deployment becomes more coupled” → scope: code dependency vs operational dependency;
- “CI is green” vs “feature is broken” → evidence quality/scope: CI did not exercise product behavior.

Never force harmony.

A contradiction that reveals a missing variable is one of the highest-value outputs HTE-Code can produce.

# 18. Engine 3 — Code Tribunal

Tribunal weighs competing explanations or designs by evidence quality, not popularity.

## Judge

Defines:

- decision to make;
- constraints;
- success criteria;
- evidence standard;
- unacceptable failure modes.

## Jury

Each juror represents a distinct candidate:

- architecture option;
- root-cause hypothesis;
- implementation strategy;
- migration path;
- security posture;
- performance strategy.

Each must provide:

```text
CLAIM
MECHANISM
EVIDENCE
ASSUMPTIONS
RISKS
FALSIFIER
CONFIDENCE
```

## Executioner

Weights by:

1. directness of evidence;
2. reproducibility;
3. freshness/current-state relevance;
4. mechanism coherence;
5. number of unsupported assumptions;
6. fit to actual constraints;
7. falsification survival;
8. reversibility and failure cost where evidence is close.

## Verdict Types

- **CLEAR** — one option strongly dominates;
- **LEANING** — one is better but uncertainty remains;
- **CONDITIONAL** — winner changes under named condition;
- **TRADEOFF** — no universal winner;
- **INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE** — run specified experiment before deciding.

“Insufficient evidence” is a valid engineering verdict.

# 19. Engineering Lens Packs

Lens Packs are dynamically activated. They are not new HTE engine numbers.

---

## Lens P — Performance and Scalability

### Questions

- Is time spent computing, waiting, spawning, allocating, blocking, parsing, serializing, transferring, or persisting?
- What is the critical path?
- What scales with N, N², network hops, files, rows, requests, shards, cores?
- What work is repeated unnecessarily?
- Where does batching eliminate fixed cost?
- What is the memory/GC/cache behavior?
- Does p99 tell a different story than average?

### Measurement Decomposition

```text
Wall time
  = CPU compute
  + scheduler wait
  + lock wait
  + I/O wait
  + network wait
  + child process wait
  + retry/backoff
  + queueing
  + GC/runtime pauses
```

**Wait ≠ work** remains a general law.

### Performance Proof

A performance claim requires a baseline and a comparable after-state.

Record:

- workload;
- environment;
- warm/cold state;
- sample count;
- median/p95/p99 as appropriate;
- CPU/memory/I/O counters;
- variance;
- exact code revision.

---

## Lens S — Security and Trust Boundaries

Map:

- assets;
- actors;
- trust boundaries;
- authentication;
- authorization;
- privilege transitions;
- secret flow;
- input boundaries;
- data classification;
- external calls;
- plugins/extensions;
- filesystem/process/network capabilities.

Look for:

- injection;
- traversal;
- unsafe deserialization;
- SSRF;
- authz bypass;
- confused deputy;
- privilege escalation;
- secret leakage;
- insecure temporary files;
- race/TOCTOU;
- dependency compromise;
- unsafe defaults;
- overbroad tokens/permissions.

Security analysis should produce defensive fixes, tests, and operational controls within the allowed scope.

---

## Lens C — Concurrency and Parallelism

Build a happens-before model.

Inspect:

- shared mutable state;
- locks;
- lock ordering;
- atomics;
- channels/queues;
- futures/promises/tasks;
- cancellation;
- thread affinity;
- async boundaries;
- reentrancy;
- double initialization;
- use-after-dispose;
- lost wakeups;
- starvation;
- thundering herd.

For each concurrent invariant:

```text
Invariant:
Writers:
Readers:
Synchronization:
Failure if violated:
Test/trace that proves it:
```

---

## Lens D — Distributed Systems

Inspect:

- partial failure;
- retry semantics;
- timeout ownership;
- idempotency;
- message ordering;
- duplicate delivery;
- clock assumptions;
- consistency model;
- leader/follower behavior;
- split brain;
- backpressure;
- queue poison messages;
- schema/version skew;
- network partitions;
- reconciliation.

Key rule:

> A remote call is not a function call with a longer cable.

---

## Lens DB — Data and Persistence

Map:

- schema;
- ownership;
- keys;
- constraints;
- transactions;
- indexes;
- query patterns;
- migration path;
- retention;
- consistency;
- caching;
- backups/recovery.

Ask:

- Is the database enforcing an invariant the application assumes?
- Can two writers violate it?
- What happens on partial migration?
- Is the query plan consistent with the access pattern?
- Is ORM behavior hiding N+1, tracking, or transaction costs?

---

## Lens API — Contracts and Compatibility

Every interface is a contract.

Inspect:

- inputs;
- outputs;
- error model;
- nullability/optionality;
- versioning;
- ordering;
- idempotency;
- pagination;
- retries;
- timeouts;
- backwards/forwards compatibility;
- serialization;
- locale/timezone;
- deprecation behavior.

Contract tests should prove externally visible promises independently from internal implementation.

---

## Lens B — Build, Toolchain, and Platform

Inspect:

- compiler/runtime versions;
- package manager behavior;
- lockfile semantics;
- generators;
- native tool dependencies;
- shell assumptions;
- filesystem semantics;
- case sensitivity;
- path length;
- symlinks;
- process spawning;
- line endings;
- locale/encoding;
- architecture (x86/x64/ARM);
- container/host differences.

A script is not sacred. Its **observable contract** is.

A compatible replacement is valid when it preserves required semantics and passes differential tests.

---

## Lens DEP — Dependency and Supply Chain

For each important dependency:

- purpose;
- direct/transitive;
- version constraint;
- maintenance state;
- security advisories;
- license;
- platform support;
- API stability;
- replacement cost;
- startup/runtime cost;
- lockfile integrity;
- vendoring/generated code implications.

Do not upgrade merely because a version is newer. Define the reason and compatibility evidence.

---

## Lens O — Observability

Ask whether the system can explain itself when it fails.

Inspect:

- structured logs;
- correlation IDs;
- traces;
- metrics;
- health checks;
- domain events;
- error context;
- sensitive-data redaction;
- sampling;
- alert quality.

Observability should answer causal questions, not merely produce more text.

---

## Lens M — Maintainability and Refactorability

Inspect:

- responsibility boundaries;
- cohesion/coupling;
- duplicated truth;
- oversized modules/functions;
- hidden global state;
- feature envy;
- shotgun surgery;
- abstraction leakage;
- configuration spread;
- names that hide lifecycle;
- dead code;
- generated vs hand-maintained ambiguity;
- agent navigability.

Do not equate “more abstraction” with “more maintainable.”

Abstractions must pay rent by eliminating repeated concrete complexity.

---

## Lens T — Testability and Verification

Inspect seams for:

- time;
- randomness;
- filesystem;
- network;
- database;
- process execution;
- environment;
- external APIs;
- concurrency.

Prefer deterministic tests where possible.

A difficult-to-test design may be revealing hidden coupling.

---

## Lens DX — Developer / Agent Experience

Inspect:

- setup friction;
- build discoverability;
- error messages;
- project navigation;
- conventions;
- docs accuracy;
- fixture/data availability;
- local CI parity;
- reproducible commands;
- agent handoff clarity.

A repo that humans and agents cannot reliably navigate has an operational defect even if runtime code is sound.

---

## Lens OPS — Operations and Release

Inspect:

- deploy topology;
- config/secrets;
- feature flags;
- database migrations;
- rollout strategy;
- rollback;
- health gates;
- versioning;
- artifact signing/integrity;
- monitoring;
- incident recovery;
- exact-head qualification.

---

# 20. Engine 4 — Edge Cases as Campaigns

Do not output a generic list of “null, empty, max size.”

Generate edge cases from the actual system model.

## Campaign Types

### Boundary Campaign

- empty;
- one item;
- maximum allowed;
- just-over-maximum;
- malformed;
- Unicode/encoding;
- extreme numeric/time values.

### Lifecycle Campaign

- startup;
- warm restart;
- shutdown during work;
- crash and recovery;
- stale cache/session;
- expired credential;
- upgrade with old state.

### Concurrency Campaign

- duplicate request;
- simultaneous create/update/delete;
- cancellation during commit;
- retry after unknown result;
- lock inversion;
- delayed message.

### Dependency Campaign

- dependency unavailable;
- slow dependency;
- malformed dependency response;
- version mismatch;
- partial response;
- rate limit.

### Resource Campaign

- disk full;
- memory pressure;
- file descriptor/socket exhaustion;
- queue saturation;
- database pool exhaustion;
- process limit.

### Adversarial Campaign

- malicious input;
- unauthorized actor;
- path manipulation;
- forged/replayed request;
- compromised dependency;
- unexpected plugin.

# 21. Engine 5 — Multisource and Cross-Domain Transfer

Code problems often have known analogues elsewhere.

Useful transfers include:

- operating systems → scheduling/backpressure;
- databases → transactional invariants;
- networking → retries/congestion;
- compilers → intermediate representations;
- game engines → hot loops/data locality;
- HFT → batching/latency discipline;
- embedded systems → bounded resource reasoning;
- biology → redundancy/adaptation;
- control theory → feedback stability;
- manufacturing → quality gates;
- aviation → checklists + incident causality;
- formal methods → invariants/property testing.

Cross-domain output must identify the transferable **mechanism**, not merely produce an analogy.

---

# 22. Inversion / Constraint-Reversal Protocol

Use when a problem appears blocked by a constraint.

Steps:

1. list explicit constraints;
2. classify hard vs soft;
3. invert one soft constraint at a time;
4. ask what mechanism would make the inverted world viable;
5. search adjacent domains for precedents;
6. identify new failure modes created by inversion;
7. build a cheap falsification experiment.

Example:

> Constraint: “We cannot edit the upstream script.”

Possible inversion:

> Preserve the script but change the implementation behind a compatible tool boundary.

This is valid only if argv semantics, outputs, side effects, and failure behavior required by the script remain compatible.

The inversion engine does not make a strange idea correct. It makes it testable.

---

# 23. Engine 11 — InvisiSynth for Software

InvisiSynth activates when the obvious documentation/search path may miss useful implementation evidence.

For software, its strongest domains are:

## 23.1 Upstream Source Archaeology

Look beyond API docs into:

- runtime/framework source;
- commit history;
- tests;
- internal comments;
- issue-linked patches.

## 23.2 Abandoned/Forked Implementations

Search:

- forks;
- old branches;
- archived repos;
- prototypes;
- abandoned packages;
- downstream patches.

An abandoned implementation may still reveal mechanism or failure history.

## 23.3 Issue/PR Archaeology

Search exact symptoms, errors, stack traces, and symbols.

Prefer issues with:

- reproduction;
- maintainer explanation;
- linked fix commit;
- regression test.

## 23.4 Research / Benchmark Literature

For algorithms, compilers, databases, distributed systems, performance, security, or ML:

- papers;
- conference proceedings;
- benchmark suites;
- technical reports;
- dissertations.

## 23.5 Production Precedents

Look for mature systems that solved the same mechanism under similar constraints.

## 23.6 Security Archaeology

For defensive work:

- CVEs;
- advisories;
- patches;
- exploit writeups at a safe analytical level;
- mitigation history.

## 23.7 Hobbyist / Maker / Niche Tooling

Useful ideas may live in:

- tiny utilities;
- specialized forums;
- build scripts;
- game modding communities;
- embedded/hardware projects;
- language-specific niches.

### InvisiSynth Evidence Rule

“Invisible,” “suppressed,” “abandoned,” or “not mainstream” is never itself proof of quality.

Every retrieved precedent must re-enter the Evidence Ledger and Tribunal.

---

# 24. Debugging Protocol

## Phase 1 — Pin the Symptom

Capture:

- exact error/wrong behavior;
- expected behavior;
- minimal reproduction if possible;
- frequency;
- environment;
- first known bad version/state;
- last known good version/state.

## Phase 2 — Establish Reproduction Quality

Classify:

- deterministic;
- load-dependent;
- race/timing-dependent;
- environment-dependent;
- data-dependent;
- intermittent/unknown.

## Phase 3 — Build Hypothesis Lattice

Generate independent causes from different system layers.

Avoid five variants of the same guess.

## Phase 4 — Instrument Before Guessing Deeper

Add the smallest observation that discriminates hypotheses:

- log at ownership boundary;
- counter;
- trace span;
- debugger watch;
- query plan;
- profiler;
- process monitor;
- network capture;
- deterministic test seam.

## Phase 5 — Root Cause

Require causal chain, not correlation.

## Phase 6 — Fix at Correct Layer

Prefer the layer where the invalid assumption originates.

Do not patch every caller around a broken shared contract.

## Phase 7 — Regression Lock

Add a test that fails for the old defect and passes for the correct mechanism.

## Phase 8 — Remove Diagnostic Debris

Remove or normalize temporary logs, debug flags, fixtures, sleeps, and bypasses unless intentionally retained as observability.

# 25. Architecture Decision Protocol

## 25.1 Define Decision

Example:

> “Choose an event delivery model that preserves at-least-once processing, supports offline consumers, and stays operable by a small team.”

Not:

> “Kafka vs RabbitMQ?”

The technology names are options, not the decision.

## 25.2 Constraints

List:

- load;
- latency;
- consistency;
- durability;
- team skill;
- deploy environment;
- budget;
- operations tolerance;
- compatibility;
- time horizon.

## 25.3 Candidate Models

Include at least one structurally different alternative.

## 25.4 Tribunal

Compare using actual constraints.

## 25.5 Future-State Simulation

Evaluate:

- 10× load;
- 10× data;
- second service/team;
- major version upgrade;
- partial outage;
- migration away.

## 25.6 Decision Record

```text
DECISION:
Context:

Chosen:
Why:

# 26. Refactoring Protocol

## 26.1 Behavior Preservation Contract

Before refactoring:

```text
PRESERVE
- public API X
- parser behavior Y
- persisted format Z
- ordering semantics Q

MAY CHANGE
- internal module structure
- private names
- implementation algorithm

INTENTIONALLY CHANGE
- documented defect A
```

## 26.2 Characterization

Where behavior lacks tests, create characterization tests around important existing behavior before moving structure.

## 26.3 Dependency Slice

Map all callers/callees/state touched by the refactor.

## 26.4 Transform in Coherent Steps

Prefer steps where each step builds/tests.

## 26.5 Delete Old Path

A refactor that leaves duplicate old/new truth creates more debt.

## 26.6 Verify Semantic Diff

Ask:

- what behavior changed unintentionally?
- what error paths moved?
- what lifecycle changed?
- what ordering changed?
- what concurrency assumption changed?

---

# 27. Performance Protocol

## 27.1 Define the Performance Question

Bad:

> “Make it faster.”

Good:

> “Reduce p95 cold-start latency on Windows from 6.2 s to <2 s without increasing steady-state memory above 300 MB.”

## 27.2 Measure Before Optimizing

Collect baseline.

## 27.3 Decompose Cost

Separate:

- CPU;
- I/O;
- network;
- lock/scheduler wait;
- process spawn;
- allocation/GC;
- serialization;
- database;
- algorithmic repetition.

## 27.4 Rank Optimizations by Leverage

Typical order:

1. eliminate unnecessary work;
2. reduce asymptotic cost;
3. batch fixed overhead;
4. remove redundant I/O/network hops;
5. fix contention;
6. improve data locality/allocation;
7. micro-optimize hot code last.

## 27.5 Verify Equivalence

A faster wrong result is a regression.

---

# 28. Security Protocol

## 28.1 Threat Model

```text
ASSET
ACTOR
ENTRY POINT
TRUST BOUNDARY
CAPABILITY
ABUSE CASE
CONTROL
TEST
RESIDUAL RISK
```

## 28.2 Authorization Before Validation

Do not treat syntactically valid input as authorized behavior.

## 28.3 Least Capability

Reduce:

- token scope;
- filesystem access;
- process execution;
- network reach;
- DB permissions;
- plugin privileges.

## 28.4 Secure Failure

Errors should not leak secrets or silently downgrade security.

## 28.5 Regression Tests

Security fixes need tests for the forbidden path as well as allowed behavior.

---

# 29. Build / Platform Failure Protocol

For host/tooling stalls:

1. identify failing command and exact argv;
2. measure wall vs CPU/I/O/process activity;
3. identify shell/runtime translation layers;
4. inspect filesystem/platform semantics;
5. isolate whether failure is semantic or merely performance;
6. build a tiny differential smoke test for any replacement/shim;
7. preserve the upstream script contract where required;
8. rerun the real build;
9. verify output tree/artifact semantics, not only exit code.

General law retained from the v1.1 IceCat case:

> **If wall-clock time is enormous while CPU work is tiny, stop treating the problem as computational complexity until wait/spawn/I/O layers have been measured.**

---

# 30. Testing Strategy — Evidence, Not Ceremony

Testing is not one lens named “unit tests.” It is a proof strategy.

## Test Types

### Unit

Pure/local behavior and invariants.

### Characterization

Lock down important legacy behavior before refactor.

### Integration

Real component interaction.

### Contract

Public boundaries independent of implementation.

### End-to-End / Product Journey

Prove user-visible intent through realistic interaction.

### Property-Based

Generate broad input spaces around invariants.

### Fuzz

Malformed/adversarial parser or protocol input.

### Concurrency

Stress race windows, duplicate operations, cancellation.

### Performance

Baseline/regression thresholds with comparable environment.

### Security

Abuse cases and permission boundaries.

### Migration

Old data/schema/version → new version.

### Recovery

Crash/restart/rollback/partial failure.

### Mutation

Where valuable, verify tests detect semantic changes rather than merely execute lines.

## Test Selection Rule

Choose tests from the **failure model**.

A test suite is strong when it would fail for the mechanisms you are afraid of.

---

# 31. Qualification Ladder

Use the weakest ladder sufficient for the stakes, but make the level explicit.

## Q0 — Static Plausibility

- code inspected;
- no execution evidence.

## Q1 — Local Compile/Lint

- syntax/type/build surface valid.

## Q2 — Targeted Tests

- changed behavior covered.

## Q3 — Relevant Regression Suite

- affected subsystem regression checked.

## Q4 — Product/Integration Qualification

- real user/system path works.

## Q5 — Release / Exact-Head Qualification

- current exact head identified;
- required CI/checks green or locally equivalent evidence available;
- artifacts validated;
- unresolved actionable review findings addressed;
- migration/rollback/release concerns satisfied;
- final diff inspected.

Do not claim Q5 from Q2 evidence.

---

# 32. Exact-Head and PR Protocol

When PR/release work is in scope:

1. query live PR state;
2. record base/head SHA;
3. inspect changed files and current diff;
4. inspect unresolved actionable review threads;
5. run/fetch qualification for the exact head;
6. fix findings;
7. if head changes, update the qualification ledger;
8. recheck review/CI state;
9. only merge when authorized and genuinely qualified;
10. verify resulting base branch frontier after merge.

## Qualification Ledger Example

```text
HEAD: abc123
BUILD: PASS — command ...
TESTS: PASS — 412 tests
E2E: PASS — journey ...
REVIEW THREADS: 0 actionable unresolved
CI: green on abc123
ARTIFACT: sha256 ...
CLAIM: Q5 qualified
```

If the head becomes `def456`, that ledger no longer automatically proves `def456`.

---

# 33. Implementation Feedback Loop

HTE-Code must be closed-loop.

```text
1. PLAN
2. PATCH
3. FORMAT / STATIC CHECK
4. BUILD
5. TARGETED TEST
6. RELEVANT REGRESSION
7. INSPECT DIFF
8. RE-RUN FAILURE REPRO / PRODUCT JOURNEY
9. REVIEW FINDINGS
10. FIX
11. QUALIFY EXACT STATE
12. SYNTHESIZE RECEIPTS
```

If a step fails, route the failure back into the Hypothesis Lattice rather than blindly applying more patches.

---

# 34. Change Impact / Blast Radius

Before a non-trivial change, map:

- direct callers;
- indirect consumers;
- shared state;
- persisted data;
- public APIs;
- generated outputs;
- tests/fixtures;
- docs/examples;
- build scripts;
- platform-specific paths;
- monitoring/operations;
- migrations.

Classify impact:

- LOCAL
- MODULE
- CROSS-MODULE
- PUBLIC CONTRACT
- DATA/SCHEMA
- OPERATIONAL
- PLATFORM
- RELEASE-WIDE

Higher blast radius increases required qualification depth.

---

# 35. Observability-Driven Diagnosis

When the system cannot answer a causal question, treat missing observability as a design gap.

Add observability at **decision boundaries**, not everywhere.

Useful boundaries:

- queue enqueue/dequeue;
- cache hit/miss/stale;
- external call start/end;
- transaction begin/commit/rollback;
- state transition;
- retry decision;
- lock acquisition wait;
- authentication/authorization decision;
- job lifecycle.

Avoid log spam that destroys signal.

---

# 36. Engine 6 — Synthesis

Synthesis collapses the analysis into a decision and action.

It must not simply concatenate engine output.

## Required Steps

1. extract strongest findings;
2. resolve or expose contradictions;
3. weight by evidence quality;
4. distinguish known vs inferred;
5. choose action under constraints;
6. integrate edge-case mitigations;
7. define success and falsification;
8. include exact qualification evidence when implementation occurred.

## Synthesis Shape

```text
THE ANSWER
  Direct conclusion / implemented result

WHY
  strongest mechanisms + evidence

WHAT CHANGED / WHAT TO DO
  ordered implementation

RISKS
  critical remaining risks only

UNCERTAINTY
  what is not yet known and what would resolve it

QUALIFICATION
  build/tests/runtime/review/exact-head receipts

CONFIDENCE
  overall X/5 + component confidence
```

Do not expose every internal branch unless the user asked for the full HTE analysis. The engine may think broadly and answer cleanly.

---

# 37. Engine 8 — Learning and Calibration

Learning is not “remember the fix.” It is “update how future reasoning should behave.”

After outcomes are known, record:

```text
Prediction:
Confidence:
Actual outcome:
Correct/incorrect/partial:
Why prediction succeeded/failed:
Which evidence was overweighted:
Which assumption was wrong:
Which lens found the decisive clue:
New reusable pattern:
```

## Calibration

Track whether 5/5 claims actually behave like near-certainties and whether 3/5 claims frequently fail.

If confidence is consistently too high, adjust.

## Failure Motifs

Examples:

- stale live-state memory;
- patched symptom instead of ownership bug;
- tests green but product intent untested;
- environment mismatch;
- hidden generated code;
- retry amplification;
- duplicated source of truth;
- version-skew assumption;
- overfit abstraction.

Learning should make these motifs easier to detect next time.

---

# 38. Confidence Model

Use X/5 for user-facing HTE-Code confidence.

## 5/5 — Strongly Established

- direct current evidence;
- mechanism confirmed;
- competing explanations falsified or negligible;
- implementation/qualification matches claim.

## 4/5 — High

- strong evidence and coherent mechanism;
- minor untested edge or environmental uncertainty.

## 3/5 — Moderate

- plausible and supported;
- meaningful assumptions or alternatives remain.

## 2/5 — Low

- incomplete evidence;
- substantial inference;
- competing hypotheses unresolved.

## 1/5 — Speculative

- weak evidence;
- idea mainly useful as experiment/search direction.

## Confidence Composition

Do not average blindly.

A release claim can be no stronger than its weakest critical dependency.

Example:

```text
Implementation correctness: 5/5
Migration safety:           2/5
Rollback evidence:          2/5
Overall release confidence: cannot exceed 2/5 until migration/rollback are resolved
```

# 39. Uncertainty Budget

At Depth ≥4, name uncertainty explicitly.

Categories:

- missing repository access;
- missing reproduction;
- environment mismatch;
- version uncertainty;
- non-determinism;
- external dependency behavior;
- incomplete test coverage;
- unknown production data shape;
- hardware/platform variation;
- human/process dependency.

Rank:

- **BLOCKING** — cannot responsibly conclude;
- **MATERIAL** — can proceed, affects confidence;
- **MINOR** — monitor;
- **IRRELEVANT TO DECISION** — do not spend cycles.

This prevents endless analysis of uncertainties that cannot change the decision.

---

# 40. Multi-Agent / Agentic Engineering Protocol

When multiple agents/reviewers are involved, parallelism must not become state corruption.

## Work Partitioning

Partition by coherent ownership:

- separate modules;
- separate review tasks;
- separate research questions;
- separate test/qualification lanes.

Avoid assigning two agents to independently rewrite the same stateful core unless intentionally comparing alternatives.

## Integration Rule

Before integrating parallel agent work:

- re-query live state;

A review is not complete when comments are generated.

For each finding:

```text

Fix every valid actionable issue within scope.

Do not blindly satisfy reviewer suggestions that conflict with code truth. Tribunal applies to review comments too.

---

# 42. Product-Intent Verification

A technically green change can still fail the request.

At qualification, translate the user’s request into product assertions.

Example:

User intent:

> “A user should be able to resume an interrupted upload.”

Weak proof:

- new resume function has unit tests.

Strong proof:

1. start upload;
2. interrupt process/network;
3. restart;
4. system discovers resumable state;
5. upload continues without duplicate/corrupt data;
6. final artifact hash matches;
7. stale resume state is cleaned up.

HTE-Code v2.0 treats **intent → observable journey** as a first-class correctness boundary.

---

# 43. Anti-Patterns HTE-Code Must Detect

## Analysis Theater

Many headings, no discriminating evidence.

## Checklist Substitution

Naming security/performance/testing without tying them to the actual system.

## Premature Root Cause

First plausible explanation becomes fact.

## Fix-by-Accretion

Keep adding conditionals around a broken invariant.

## Test Theater

Tests execute code but do not prove intended behavior.

## Green-CI Fallacy

“CI green” interpreted as “product correct.”

## Stale-Head Fallacy

Old test run applied to new commit.

## Abstraction Fever

Creating generic frameworks before repeated concrete needs exist.

## Architecture by Fashion

Selecting microservices, event sourcing, CQRS, Rust, Kubernetes, etc. because the label sounds advanced.

## Authority Closure

“Official docs say so” ends mechanism inquiry.

## Anti-Authority Closure

“Official docs say so, therefore opposite is true.” Same failure, mirrored.

## Local-Fix Blindness

Fixing a call site when ownership/contracts are wrong upstream.

## Infinite Audit

Building more evaluators instead of changing or qualifying the product.

---

# 44. Dynamic Output Modes

HTE-Code should think at requested depth but tailor visible output.

## Compact

For normal use:

- diagnosis/decision;
- key evidence;
- action;
- verification;
- confidence.

## Engineering

For implementation:

- problem frame;
- files/components;
- implementation plan;
- tests;
- risks;
- qualification.

## Forensic

For Depth 5 or explicit full HTE:

- clarified question;
- assumption/evidence registers;
- Oracle branches;
- mechanical model;
- lens findings;
- hypothesis lattice;
- contradictions;
- Tribunal;
- implementation;
- qualification;
- learning targets.

## Handoff

For long chats/agent transfer:

- exact live frontier;
- decisions;
- evidence;
- remaining blocker;
- next discriminating action;
- no history rebuild unless live state requires it.

# 50. HTE-Code v1.1 → v2.0 Depth-5 Self-Analysis

This section records the Depth-5 HTE run performed on HTE-Code itself.

## 50.1 Clarified Question

**Original intent:** Extend HTE-Code far beyond its current basic capabilities by running the parent HTE at Depth 5 on HTE-Code itself.

**Clarified engineering question:**

> What architectural capabilities from the full HTE are missing, collapsed, mis-mapped, overfit, or non-operational in HTE-Code v1.1, and what general software-engineering protocol would turn it from a checklist into a closed-loop reasoning, implementation, and qualification engine?

**Reframe confidence:** 5/5

## 50.2 Oracle Findings

### Architecture Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 has a semantic identity collision: original HTE Engine 7/8/9/10 roles are repurposed. This weakens lineage and removes first-class Memory/Learning/Affect behavior.

**v2 fix:** preserve canonical HTE numbering; make software capabilities lens packs.

### Debugging Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 lists failure modes but lacks a disciplined hypothesis/experiment loop. It can generate plausible explanations without requiring discriminating evidence.

**v2 fix:** Hypothesis Lattice + falsifiers + root-cause standard.

### Repository Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 can reason about code but has no explicit repo truth-acquisition protocol.

**v2 fix:** reconnaissance of branch/head/tree/build/dependencies/tests/history before exact claims.

### Evidence Perspective — 5/5

Confidence scores exist, but there is no provenance model explaining what earns confidence.

**v2 fix:** Evidence Ledger E0–E5, freshness/scope/provenance, confidence composition.

### Execution Perspective — 4/5

v1.1 says “execute, do not ask,” but the execution loop is underspecified.

**v2 fix:** plan → patch → build → test → inspect → product journey → review → qualification.

### Generalization Perspective — 5/5

The core v1.1 text is overfit to an IceCat/Windows incident. Specific details such as GNU `find`, 7-Zip, Mozilla keys, and Savannah transport are useful Memory/example data, not universal engine definitions.

**v2 fix:** extract general laws and move incident-specific knowledge out of core architecture.

### Testing Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 testing examples are smoke-test oriented and do not provide a full verification model.

**v2 fix:** characterization, contract, E2E/product journey, property, fuzz, concurrency, performance, security, migration, recovery, exact-head qualification.

### Architecture/Change Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 lacks behavior-preservation contracts, blast-radius mapping, architecture decision records, migration/rollback, and state ownership analysis.

**v2 fix:** dedicated protocols.

### Learning Perspective — 5/5

v1.1 mentions Memory but not meaningful calibration from predicted vs actual outcomes.

**v2 fix:** restore Engine 8 Learning with prediction calibration and failure motifs.

### Contradiction Perspective — 4/5

v1.1 correctly adds Contradiction Resolution, but does not make contradiction mapping a core shared state or systematically route unresolved conflicts into experiments.

**v2 fix:** contradiction map + missing-variable discovery + experiment/Tribunal routing.

## 50.3 Mechanical Deconstruction of v1.1

### Existing strengths

- mechanism-first attitude;
- confidence requirements;
- FilterStack integration;
- Tribunal/falsification concept;
- Clarification and Contradiction engines;
- explicit anti-stall behavior;
- implementation orientation;
- awareness of host/platform performance differences.

### Missing structural organs

1. canonical engine topology;
2. repo evidence acquisition;
3. shared evidence/assumption state;
4. hypothesis lifecycle;
5. runtime/state ownership model;
6. change impact model;
7. operational depth semantics;
8. broad verification ladder;
9. exact-state qualification;
10. learning/calibration loop;
11. agent integration/handoff protocol;
12. dynamic output control.

### Highest leverage point

The single highest-leverage change is not “add more checklists.” It is:

> **Make every branch operate over shared evidence, assumptions, and hypotheses, then require implementation and qualification to feed new evidence back into the same model.**

That converts HTE-Code from a one-pass advisor into a closed-loop engineering system.

## 50.4 Tribunal

### Judge

Decision standard: the successor must preserve useful v1.1 behavior while restoring parent HTE architecture and adding capabilities that materially improve real engineering correctness.

### Candidate A — Keep v1.1 and add more headings

**Evidence:** cheap, backward compatible.  
**Failure:** increases checklist size without correcting topology or closed-loop reasoning.  
**Confidence as sufficient solution:** 1/5.

### Candidate B — Replace HTE-Code with a language-specific mega-checklist

**Evidence:** HTE-DOTNET Ultra demonstrates that deep specialization can be very powerful.  
**Failure:** general HTE-Code must work across languages and would become bloated/fragile if every ecosystem detail lived in the core.  
**Confidence as general solution:** 2/5.

### Candidate C — Restore HTE topology + dynamic engineering lens packs + evidence/implementation loop

**Evidence:** matches the parent HTE’s modular architecture, preserves specialization, allows Depth 5 to change behavior, and directly addresses the identified missing mechanisms.  
**Failure risk:** requires disciplined lens activation so output does not become enormous by default.  
**Confidence:** 5/5.

### Verdict

**Candidate C wins clearly.**

HTE-Code should be a stable reasoning kernel with dynamic software lens packs, evidence structures, and task-specific protocols.

## 50.5 Contradictions Resolved

### C1 — “HTE-Code should be comprehensive” vs “Do not dump ceremony into every task”

**Type:** SCOPE.  
**Resolution:** internal depth can be broad while visible output is dynamically compact.  
**Confidence:** 5/5.

### C2 — “Preserve parent HTE” vs “Add deep code specialization”

**Type:** DEFINITIONAL/ARCHITECTURAL.  
**Resolution:** preserve engine identities; specialization lives in lens packs/protocols.  
**Confidence:** 5/5.

### C3 — “Execute after synthesis” vs “Analysis must remain falsifiable”

**Type:** MISSING VARIABLE.  
**Missing variable:** feedback from execution.  
**Resolution:** execution is an experiment that updates hypotheses and can invalidate the plan.  
**Confidence:** 5/5.

### C4 — “Confidence score mandatory” vs “Confidence can be arbitrary”

**Type:** EVIDENCE QUALITY.  
**Resolution:** bind confidence to evidence directness, reproduction, freshness, assumptions, and falsification survival.  
**Confidence:** 5/5.

## 50.6 Edge-Case Findings

The v2 architecture specifically guards against:

- no repo access;
- stale handoffs;
- green CI with wrong product behavior;
- exact-head drift;
- nondeterministic failures;
- generated code being mistaken for source of truth;
- platform-specific build semantics;
- reviewers being wrong;
- user request already authorizing implementation;
- migration risk hiding behind passing unit tests;
- architecture fashion overriding constraints;
- too much analysis for trivial tasks;
- Depth 5 becoming infinite recursion.

## 50.7 Final Self-Assessment

| Capability | v1.1 | v2.0 | Confidence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Parent HTE topology | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Debugging rigor | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Evidence provenance | 1/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Repo awareness | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Architecture analysis | 3/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| Refactor safety | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Performance depth | 3/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Security model | 2/5 | 4/5 | 4/5 |
| Concurrency/distributed | 1/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Testing/qualification | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Exact-state PR/release proof | 1/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Execution feedback loop | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Memory/learning/calibration | 2/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Multi-agent handoff | 1/5 | 5/5 | 4/5 |
| Anti-overanalysis controls | 3/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |

**Overall HTE assessment of v2.0 design:** 5/5 confidence that this is a materially deeper and more faithful general HTE-Code architecture than v1.1.

The remaining uncertainty is implementation-dependent: different coding agents and models will vary in how faithfully they maintain the shared evidence state and resist premature closure. The specification therefore emphasizes observable artifacts, falsifiers, and qualification rather than trusting the reasoning process by declaration.

# 51. Source Lineage

This edition was derived from and cross-checked against the supplied HTE materials, especially:

- `HTE-Code-v1.0.md` / current v1.1 seed;
- `HTE-Newest(1).zip` parent HTE archive;
- Engine 1 Parallel Oracle;
- Engine 2 Mechanical Deconstruction;
- Engine 3 Tribunal;
- Engine 4 Edge Case;
- Engine 5 Multisource;
- Engine 6 Synthesis;
- Engine 7 Memory;
- Engine 8 Learning;
- Engine 9 Affect;
- Engine 10 Parallel Oracle expansion;
- Engine 11 InvisiSynth;
- Engine 14 Clarification;
- Engine 15 Contradiction Resolution;
- HTE architecture/core-thinking documents;
- HTE-DOTNET v2.0 Ultra as evidence that depth and specialization can be operational rather than cosmetic.

The parent HTE remains the conceptual architecture. HTE-Code v2.0 is its software-engineering specialization.

# 52. Final Rules

1. **Think holographically; answer concretely.**
2. **Preserve canonical HTE engine meanings.**
3. **Activate code lens packs only when relevant.**
4. **Acquire current system truth before exact claims.**
5. **Separate observation, interpretation, hypothesis, conclusion, and decision.**
6. **Every leading hypothesis needs a falsifier at Depth 5.**
7. **Mechanism outranks slogans and fashion.**
8. **Tests must prove the failure model and product intent.**
9. **Implementation is part of reasoning because execution returns evidence.**
10. **Qualification belongs to an exact state.**
11. **Memory is context, not a substitute for re-querying live state.**
12. **Learning updates calibration, not just stored facts.**
13. **Do not create generic abstractions until concrete repeated needs earn them.**
14. **Do not create audits whose only product is more audits.**
15. **When implementation is already authorized, do the work.**

# 53. Attached Specialist: huechart — Avalonia Color/Hue & Visibility Chart

**Load the `huechart` skill for ANY pass that touches theme colors, contrast,
palette balance, hue harmony, or dark/light-mode legibility in Avalonia/WPF/XAML
projects** (`C:\Users\User\.claude\skills\huechart\SKILL.md`). It is a fixed
companion of HTE-Code on theming work — this section is the direct call.

Three zones, three files (full chart at plain-markdown tables; no images):

| Zone | File(s) | What lives there |
|------|---------|------------------|
| 🧪 **C# color machinery** | `huechart/references/csharp-helpers.md` | Portable C#: WCAG relative luminance, contrast ratio, RGB↔HSL/hue, perceptual distance, `AuditTheme` sketch. Mirror in-repo: `RitualOS.ThemeContrast` + `ThemeContrastAuditor` + `ThemeBalanceAuditTests`. |
| 👁 **Human visibility** | `huechart/references/hue-wheel.md`, `luminance.md`, `contrast.md` | Hue wheel + harmony recipes; perceived luminance + dark/light surface bands; contrast formula, AA/AAA thresholds, quick matrix, and the full required pair set. |
| 🚨 **Immediate fix — imperceptible by humans** | `huechart/references/palette-balance.md` (§2 defect catalog) | D1–D8 "AI-visible, human-invisible" defects: roll-keys with contrast < 1.15:1, RGB distance < 24, same-hue same-luminance pairs, duplicate hexes. **Every hit must be resolved before a theme is complete.** |

Execution rules when this hook fires:

1. Run `contrast` on every intended pair (4.5 body / 3.0 large + non-text).
2. Run the `imperceptible` detector (contrast < 1.15:1 or RGB distance < 24) across
   all role-keys — anything flagged is an identity bug invisible to a reviewer and
   goes straight to the fix list (merge or split by luminance ≥ 3:1).
3. Re-verify balance (60-30-10, one hue family, luminance ladder, text neutrality).
4. Re-run the full theme fingerprint until zero failures, then qualify as normal.

Memorize the invariants: `L = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B` (linear channels);
`contrast = (L1+0.05)/(L2+0.05)`; floors `7.0 / 4.5 / 3.0 / 1.15`.

# RESOLVED PACK: language.cpp

## PACK DOCUMENT: CONCERNS.md

# cpp Depth-5 Language/DSL Concerns

This is a language-specific augmentation of the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline.
Every concern below must be interpreted with the repo's actual compiler, runtime, platform,
toolchain, flags, version, and interop seams. Language facts never substitute for those layers.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Object lifetime, storage duration, value categories, and temporary materialization are correctness rules, not style details.
- Move semantics can leave valid-but-unspecified objects; use-after-move assumptions must be justified by the specific type.
- References and iterators dangle after container mutation, reallocation, owner destruction, or temporary lifetime expiration.
- RAII only works when ownership is singular/intentional; raw/shared/unique pointers encode very different lifetime contracts.
- shared_ptr cycles, aliasing constructors, enable_shared_from_this misuse, and custom deleters create non-obvious ownership graphs.
- Undefined behavior enables optimizer transformations far beyond the local expression where the defect originates.
- One Definition Rule violations can survive compilation and produce link- or runtime-dependent behavior.
- Templates instantiate only used paths; untested substitutions hide diagnostics until a new type reaches them.
- Overload resolution, implicit conversions, ADL, deduction, concepts, and forwarding references can select surprising functions.
- Exceptions interact with destructors, noexcept, move selection, partial construction, and ABI boundaries.
- Static initialization/destruction order across translation units is not a safe dependency mechanism.
- Virtual dispatch during construction/destruction and slicing can violate polymorphic expectations.
- RTTI, dynamic_cast, typeid, visibility, and shared-library boundaries depend on build/link settings.
- Allocator ownership must not cross incompatible CRT/library boundaries; new/delete family matching is mandatory.
- The memory model requires atomics/happens-before reasoning; volatile is primarily about observable accesses, not thread safety.
- Coroutines introduce frame lifetime, captured-reference, cancellation, exception, and scheduler ownership questions.
- Ranges/views are often lazy and can retain references to dead sources or re-run expensive work.
- ABI and standard-library compatibility depend on compiler, runtime, flags, iterator-debug level, packing, and C++ standard mode.

# HTE-Code Language Pack: cpp

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** language-specific augmentation; canonical HTE engines remain unchanged.
**Maturity:** seeded (signature failure mechanics present; expansion continues)

## Depth-5 activation

Run this pack whenever repository evidence shows this language or generated/executed artifacts in it.
Do not substitute a neighboring language pack. Compiler, runtime, toolchain and interop packs are additive.

## Signature concern catalog

### object-lifetime

**Mechanism:** RAII helps only when ownership and object lifetime are modeled correctly; temporaries, references, moves and destruction order remain semantic.

**Detection:** trace owner/reference/move/destructor relationships.

**Adversarial edge:** dangling view/span, moved-from use, static destruction.

**Qualification:** ASan/UBSan + lifetime-focused tests.

### templates-odr

**Mechanism:** Templates, inline entities, ODR and instantiation across translation units can yield link or ABI failures.

**Detection:** inspect definitions, explicit instantiations, visibility and macro-dependent headers.

**Adversarial edge:** different defines per TU, plugin boundary.

**Qualification:** clean multi-config build and symbol inspection.

### exceptions-noexcept

**Mechanism:** Exception safety guarantees, noexcept, destructor behavior and allocation failure govern partial mutation.

**Detection:** classify strong/basic/nothrow guarantees.

**Adversarial edge:** throw at each mutation/allocation point.

**Qualification:** fault-injection preserves invariant.

### concurrency-memory

**Mechanism:** Data-race freedom and the C++ memory model require atomic ordering/happens-before, not just locks that look plausible.

**Detection:** construct happens-before graph.

**Adversarial edge:** relaxed/acquire-release edges, teardown race.

**Qualification:** TSan/stress plus invariant checking.

### abi

**Mechanism:** STL type ABI, RTTI/exceptions, compiler flags, packing and CRT ownership matter across DLL/plugin boundaries.

**Detection:** map binary interface and allocator ownership.

**Adversarial edge:** compiler/version/runtime mismatch.

**Qualification:** binary compatibility fixture.

## Mandatory cross-passes

- Map syntax/type facts separately from compiler/runtime implementation facts.
- Enumerate undefined, unspecified, implementation-defined, dynamic, or host-defined behavior where the language permits it.
- Trace resource lifetime, errors, concurrency/ordering, external input, serialization and generated-code boundaries where applicable.
- Run negative-space analysis: declared/loaded/typed is not proof of execution or consumption.
- Bind every strong claim to direct repo/runtime evidence at the appropriate tier.
- Record version/dialect/compiler/runtime qualifiers instead of universalizing one implementation.

## Expansion backlog

This seeded pack must continue accumulating standard-library traps, production failure signatures,

## PACK DOCUMENT: FULL-COVERAGE.md

# Full Coverage Addendum
- **Numerics:** signed overflow remains UB; unsigned wraps; float NaN/-0/rounding, narrowing conversions, chrono duration ratios, size_t/ptrdiff_t and SIMD widths need explicit boundary tests and checked conversion where domain requires.
- **False-positive guard:** RAII, move-after-state inspection, placement new, aliasing views or lock-free atomics can trigger simplistic lints despite valid invariants. Suppress only at the narrow construct with lifetime/memory-model proof and test.

# cpp-header Depth-5 Language/DSL Concerns

This is a language-specific augmentation of the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline.
Every concern below must be interpreted with the repo's actual compiler, runtime, platform,
toolchain, flags, version, and interop seams. Language facts never substitute for those layers.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Header-only C++ code participates in every consumer's template, macro, standard-version, and compiler environment.
- ODR violations arise from inconsistent macros, inline definitions, constexpr variables, generated configuration, or differing flags.
- Incomplete types are permitted only at specific boundaries; inline destructors and sizeof/member access force completeness.
- Template implementation visibility is required at instantiation unless explicit instantiation is deliberately arranged.
- Concepts/SFINAE diagnostics can mask the real substitution that failed; preserve minimal repros for compiler-specific failures.
- Dependent names require typename/template disambiguation and two-phase lookup varies in diagnostics across compilers.
- ADL and unqualified helper calls in headers can bind to consumer namespaces unexpectedly.
- Macro/configuration state can change class layout and inline behavior across translation units, creating ABI corruption.
- Visibility/export annotations must match DLL/shared-library build mode and explicit-instantiation strategy.
- pragma pack/warning/diagnostic state must be push/pop balanced.
- Includes should not rely on another header's transitive includes; self-containment is a qualification target.
- constexpr/consteval code moves runtime failures into compile-time resource/diagnostic behavior and version support.
- Header-generated static state can accidentally become per-TU or globally shared depending on linkage.
- Public exception/noexcept and allocator choices become ABI/API commitments.
- Qualification compiles representative consumers with each supported compiler/standard mode, not only the owning library.

# HTE-Code Language Pack: cpp-header

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** language-specific augmentation; canonical HTE engines remain unchanged.
**Maturity:** seeded (signature failure mechanics present; expansion continues)

## Depth-5 activation

Run this pack whenever repository evidence shows this language or generated/executed artifacts in it.
Do not substitute a neighboring language pack. Compiler, runtime, toolchain and interop packs are additive.

## Signature concern catalog

### templates

**Mechanism:** Template definitions and inline variables/functions in headers instantiate per translation unit under ODR rules.

**Detection:** inspect dependent definitions and instantiation visibility.

**Adversarial edge:** different compiler flags/macros per TU.

**Qualification:** multi-TU link/LTO matrix.

### concepts-sfinae

**Mechanism:** Constraints/SFINAE/ADL can select overloads unexpectedly as types or includes change.

**Detection:** enumerate candidate overloads and constraints.

**Adversarial edge:** implicit conversion, hidden friend, new overload.

**Qualification:** compile-time positive/negative fixtures.

### module-boundary

**Mechanism:** Header units/precompiled headers/modules can expose hidden include-order or macro assumptions.

**Detection:** compare cold include vs PCH/module path.

**Adversarial edge:** macro before import/include.

**Qualification:** build both paths.

### abi-inline

**Mechanism:** Inline/template changes can silently change binary behavior across separately built consumers.

**Detection:** identify exported inline/template ABI surface.

**Adversarial edge:** old consumer + new library/header mismatch.

**Qualification:** version-skew consumer fixture.

## Mandatory cross-passes

- Map syntax/type facts separately from compiler/runtime implementation facts.
- Enumerate undefined, unspecified, implementation-defined, dynamic, or host-defined behavior where the language permits it.
- Trace resource lifetime, errors, concurrency/ordering, external input, serialization and generated-code boundaries where applicable.
- Run negative-space analysis: declared/loaded/typed is not proof of execution or consumption.
- Bind every strong claim to direct repo/runtime evidence at the appropriate tier.
- Record version/dialect/compiler/runtime qualifiers instead of universalizing one implementation.

## Expansion backlog

This seeded pack must continue accumulating standard-library traps, production failure signatures,
version-specific deltas, static-analysis rules, edge campaigns, and repo-learned motifs.


## PACK DOCUMENT: FULL-COVERAGE.md

# Full Coverage Addendum
- **Numerics:** templates/constants in headers can instantiate at many widths/types; constrain arithmetic, narrowing and overflow instead of assuming one consumer type.
- **Performance:** header-only templates/inline functions can multiply compile time and code size through instantiation; profile build size/time and emitted symbols where the header is widely included.
- **Migration:** compiler/standard/library/feature-macro changes can alter overload/concept selection and inline ABI across consumers; test mixed-version/public-header compatibility when binary consumers exist.
- **False-positive guard:** duplicate-looking declarations, forward declarations or inline/template definitions can be required for ODR/ABI/generic use; prove redundancy across translation units before removal.

# c-cpp-compiler-unspecified Depth-5 Compiler/Assembler Concerns

This implementation pack augments HTE-Code v2 Depth 5.
Compiler/assembler acceptance, diagnostics, generated artifacts, optimization,
linkage and runtime behavior must remain separate evidence tiers.

## High-signal implementation mechanics

- Identity gate: resolve MSVC, GCC, Clang or another compiler, version, language mode, target triple, standard library and linker before compiler-specific claims.
- Parser/grammar: extensions, default language mode and warning diagnostics differ; successful parsing under one compiler is not portability evidence.
- Binding/modules: include paths, predefined macros, modules/PCH and linker symbol rules are implementation/build dependent.
- Type semantics: ABI widths, enum underlying choices, wchar_t, long double, bitfields and extension types vary by target/compiler.
- Numeric limits: signed overflow is language UB, but diagnostics/optimization and extended precision differ across implementations.
- Memory/lifetime: sanitizers, lifetime analysis and optimizer assumptions expose different defects; absence of one diagnostic proves little.
- Errors/recovery: preprocess/parse/type/codegen/assembler/link errors must be separated before changing source.
- Concurrency: language memory model is common, but sanitizer/runtime instrumentation and target atomics support vary.
- Serialization: raw structs/bitfields/padding cannot be assumed compatible while compiler/ABI is unknown.
- Security: stack-protector, CFI, sanitizer and hardening flags are implementation-specific defenses, not language guarantees.
- ABI/interop: name mangling, calling convention, packing, CRT/allocator, exception/RTTI and STL ABI must remain unresolved until toolchain is known.
- Platform: target architecture, object format, runtime library and linker determine binary compatibility.
- Libraries: standard library implementation/version is a separate compatibility surface from compiler front end.
- Performance: optimizer/vectorizer/LTO behavior cannot support claims without exact compiler flags and benchmark.
- Testing: build at least the real compiler/configuration; alternate strict compiler is useful portability evidence where supported.
- Instrumentation: record full compile/link commands, predefined macros, object metadata and emitted assembly for critical code.
- Failure signatures: parse differences suggest dialect/extension; unresolved externals suggest linkage/ABI; optimized-only failures suggest UB/lifetime/race.
- Undefined/implementation-defined: explicitly catalogue language UB/unspecified/implementation-defined behavior instead of attributing it to a guessed compiler.
- Migration: compiler/standard-library/runtime upgrades require ABI, warning, optimizer and generated-code qualification.
- Negative-space: IDE syntax service or one successful compile does not identify the compiler used by CI/release.
- False-positive guard: vendor extensions may be intentional platform code; require portability target evidence before removing them.
- Learning motif: activate and enrich the concrete compiler pack once build evidence identifies it.

# HTE-Code Compiler Pack: c-cpp-compiler-unspecified

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** compiler-specific augmentation; language packs remain separate and additive.
**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### identify

**Mechanism:** C/C++ semantics interact with implementation extensions, ABI and optimizer; compiler must be identified before compiler-specific claims.

**Detection:** resolve build command/compiler/version/target.

**Adversarial edge:** same code under MSVC/GCC/Clang.

**Qualification:** identify exact implementation or keep claims language-only.

### compare

**Mechanism:** Use at least one alternate compiler or strict mode for portability-sensitive code where feasible.

**Detection:** cross-compile focused units.

**Adversarial edge:** warning/UB disagreement.

**Qualification:** document implementation dependence.

## Depth-5 rules

- Resolve exact version, target, flags, feature switches and generated/intermediate artifacts before strong implementation-specific claims.
- Separate source-language legality from compiler acceptance, emitted artifact semantics and runtime behavior.
- Compare clean and incremental paths where caches/generation exist.
- Treat warnings, optimizations, link/load stages and generated outputs as evidence surfaces.
- Downgrade confidence when the exact implementation cannot be identified.

# native Depth-5 Runtime Concerns

This pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline. Version, target, flags, host, and adjacent packs remain part of the proof.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Native execution inherits OS ABI, CPU ISA/features, loader, C/C++ runtime, dynamic libraries, allocator and signal/exception model.
- Build-machine success does not prove target-machine instruction support or library availability.
- Debuggers/sanitizers can alter timing/layout; release behavior needs its own run evidence.
- Dynamic loader search order and side-by-side libraries can execute a different dependency than inspection assumes.
- Process architecture (x86/x64/ARM), calling conventions, stack alignment and object ABI must match every binary boundary.
- ASLR/DEP/CFG/hardening, page permissions and code signing can change behavior of low-level techniques.
- Locale/timezone/encoding/filesystem and environment remain runtime inputs.
- Qualification captures executable identity, dependent-library resolution, target CPU/OS and representative real execution.

# HTE-Code Runtime Pack: native

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** runtime-specific augmentation; language packs remain separate and additive.
**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### process-memory

**Mechanism:** Native execution exposes OS virtual memory, signals/SEH, stack/heap allocator and ABI directly.

**Detection:** map allocation, mappings, exceptions/signals.

**Adversarial edge:** OOM, guard page, stack exhaustion.

**Qualification:** sanitizers/debugger/fault injection.

### dynamic-loader

**Mechanism:** DLL/SO search path, symbol versioning and initialization order can load wrong binaries.

**Detection:** record resolved module paths/symbols.

**Adversarial edge:** duplicate library/path precedence.

**Qualification:** runtime module provenance.

### cpu

**Mechanism:** ISA/features/alignment/cache/memory model depend on target architecture.

**Detection:** record target and feature dispatch.

**Adversarial edge:** unsupported instruction, misalignment, weak ordering.

**Qualification:** target hardware/emulator test.

## Depth-5 rules

- Resolve exact version, target, flags, feature switches and generated/intermediate artifacts before strong implementation-specific claims.
- Separate source-language legality from compiler acceptance, emitted artifact semantics and runtime behavior.
- Compare clean and incremental paths where caches/generation exist.
- Treat warnings, optimizations, link/load stages and generated outputs as evidence surfaces.
- Downgrade confidence when the exact implementation cannot be identified.


## PACK DOCUMENT: GAPS.md

# Native Runtime Depth-5 Gap Closure

## Syntax boundary, concurrency, serialization
- Source syntax no longer matters once execution reaches machine code; debugging must map addresses back through symbols, optimizations, inlining and generated code without assuming source-line order.
- Native concurrency is governed by language memory model, OS scheduler, atomics, synchronization primitives, signals/APCs/interrupts and library contracts.
- Files, sockets, shared memory, pipes, structs, ioctl/device buffers and process argv/environment are serialization/representation boundaries even when they look like raw bytes.

## Failure signatures, migration, negative-space, learning
- Common production symptoms: access violation/segfault at a later use than the corrupting write, heap corruption reported during unrelated free, deadlock only under load, loader failure due to missing symbol/DLL/SO, stack corruption on return, data race disappearing under debugger, and release-only optimizer exposure.
- Runtime/OS/loader/allocator/CPU behavior is implementation-defined around areas the source language leaves unspecified or undefined.
- Migration across architecture, compiler runtime, libc/CRT, OS, allocator, instruction set or hardening flags requires ABI and performance requalification.
- Negative-space check: successful link/load is not proof each symbol path, optional CPU feature, lazy-loaded module or error path is valid.
- False-positive guard: sanitizer/debugger reports can originate in third-party code or intentional low-level patterns, but suppression requires a narrow valid-context proof and regression fixture.
- Learning motifs should preserve crash address/symbolized stack, module versions, allocator/sanitizer, architecture and concurrency/load context.

# cmake Depth-5 Toolchain Concerns

This pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline. It must be composed with the actual language, compiler/runtime, platform and repo authority.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- CMake is a configure/generate system, not the compiler; generator, cache, toolchain file and compiler form one build identity.
- Cached variables can preserve obsolete paths/options across source changes; a clean configure is distinct evidence.
- Configure-time vs generate-time generator expressions have different evaluation contexts.
- PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE usage requirements propagate includes/defines/link libraries transitively and can leak accidental ABI settings.
- Directory/global commands and target-based commands have very different blast radius; order affects legacy directory properties.
- Multi-config generators and single-config generators interpret CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE/configuration differently.
- find_package can select config/module/system/vcpkg/conan copies based on prefixes/cache/environment.
- Toolchain files and cross compilation distinguish host tools from target artifacts.
- Custom commands need complete OUTPUT/BYPRODUCTS/DEPENDS declarations or parallel/incremental builds can race/stale.
- File globbing may fail to trigger reconfigure for new files unless configured appropriately.
- Install/export/package configs need relocatability and transitive dependency correctness separate from local build success.
- Qualification records CMake version, generator, cache/toolchain variables, exact compiler and clean configure/build/test.

# HTE-Code Toolchain Pack: cmake

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** toolchain-specific augmentation; all other detected packs remain additive.
**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### configure-build

**Mechanism:** Configure cache and generator decisions persist; changing source/toolchain may not invalidate cache as expected.

**Detection:** inspect CMakeCache and generated commands.

**Adversarial edge:** fresh build dir vs reused.

**Qualification:** clean configure/build equivalence.

### scope

**Mechanism:** Variables, target properties, directory scope and generator expressions can affect only some configs/targets.

**Detection:** trace target properties and expressions.

**Adversarial edge:** multi-config Debug/Release.

**Qualification:** compile_commands/build matrix.

### find-package

**Mechanism:** Package discovery depends on prefix paths/config/module mode and host environment.

**Detection:** trace --debug-find and imported targets.

**Adversarial edge:** different machine/cache.

**Qualification:** hermetic/fresh-env configure.

## Depth-5 rules

- Resolve exact version/configuration/consumer before universalizing behavior.
- Separate declaration/configuration/loading from actual execution and observable effect.
- Run negative-space checks for configured-but-unused, loaded-but-unconsumed and tested-but-unexercised paths.
- Preserve exact evidence tier for build, static, integration and runtime claims.
- Add repo-learned failure motifs back into this pack only when they generalize beyond one repository.


## PACK DOCUMENT: GAPS.md

# CMake Depth-5 Gap Closure

- **Syntax/parser:** CMake language has list/string semantics, variable dereferencing, function/macro scope, generator expressions and policy-controlled parsing behavior; quoting/list separators are common footguns.
- **Memory/lifetime:** configure cache, generated files, fetched dependencies and build-directory state persist across runs and can outlive source/config changes.
- **Concurrency:** generated build systems may execute custom commands/targets in parallel; undeclared BYPRODUCTS/DEPENDS create races and stale artifacts.
- **Libraries/ecosystem:** find_package/imported targets, FetchContent, pkg-config, vcpkg/conan/toolchain files and platform SDK discovery are dependency-resolution surfaces.
- **Performance:** configure time, dependency fetching, unity/PCH/LTO choices, generated build graph and parallelism affect build latency/memory.
- **Failure signatures:** stale CMakeCache points to removed SDK, find_package chooses wrong copy, custom command runs twice/races, multi-config target uses wrong config artifact, transitive include/define/link requirement missing due to PRIVATE/PUBLIC misuse.
- **Undefined/implementation-defined:** generator/platform/toolchain package discovery and filesystem/environment inputs are machine scoped.
- **Migration:** CMake policies, minimum version, generator, compiler/toolchain files and dependency package configs can alter behavior without source-code changes.
- **False-positive guard:** duplicated target/property or cache value is not automatically wrong when intentionally conditional; inspect evaluated target properties and generated build command.

# markdown Depth-5 Format Concerns

This pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline. It must be composed with the actual language, compiler/runtime, platform and repo authority.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Markdown has competing dialects/extensions; CommonMark/GFM/front matter/wiki/task/math/MDX behavior must be scoped to the actual renderer.
- Blank lines, indentation and list continuation rules can change block structure unexpectedly.
- Code fences need language and delimiter lengths that safely contain embedded fence text.
- HTML-in-Markdown support and sanitization differ by renderer and trust boundary.
- Link/reference definitions can resolve far from use and duplicate labels have dialect-specific behavior.
- Autolinks, bare URLs, underscores and emphasis parsing produce renderer-dependent edge cases.
- Tables/task lists/strikethrough are extensions rather than universal core syntax.
- Relative links/images resolve against repository/site/render context, not the author's editor cwd.
- Front matter is another format layer whose delimiter/schema belongs to the site/toolchain.
- Generated documentation can be syntactically valid Markdown but semantically stale or falsely claim runtime evidence.
- Qualification renders with the actual documentation/site pipeline and verifies links, code blocks, headings and truth against implementation.

# HTE-Code Format Pack: markdown

**Baseline:** HTE-Code v2 Depth 5
**Role:** format-specific augmentation; all other detected packs remain additive.
**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### dialect

**Mechanism:** CommonMark/GFM/tool-specific extensions differ in tables, task lists, HTML and link parsing.

**Detection:** identify renderer.

**Adversarial edge:** nested list/fence/table edge.

**Qualification:** render fixture.

### code-fence

**Mechanism:** Fenced examples can become stale or syntactically invalid while document still renders.

**Detection:** extract and test executable snippets where claims depend on them.

**Adversarial edge:** versioned CLI/API example.

**Qualification:** doc-test.

### truth

**Mechanism:** Documentation is an evidence claim surface; aspirational prose must not be mistaken for implemented behavior.

**Detection:** cross-link strong claims to code/tests/runtime evidence.

**Adversarial edge:** feature described but absent.

**Qualification:** feature-truth audit.

## Depth-5 rules

- Resolve exact version/configuration/consumer before universalizing behavior.
- Separate declaration/configuration/loading from actual execution and observable effect.
- Run negative-space checks for configured-but-unused, loaded-but-unconsumed and tested-but-unexercised paths.
- Preserve exact evidence tier for build, static, integration and runtime claims.
- Add repo-learned failure motifs back into this pack only when they generalize beyond one repository.


## PACK DOCUMENT: FULL-COVERAGE.md

# Full Coverage Addendum
- **Undefined/implementation-defined behavior:** Markdown outside a fixed dialect is implementation-defined by the renderer and extension set. Even under CommonMark/GFM, HTML sanitization, heading-ID generation, syntax highlighting, link rewriting and plugin directives are hosting-tool behavior rather than universal Markdown semantics.


## PACK DOCUMENT: GAPS.md

# Markdown Depth-5 Gap Closure

## Parser, dialect, and control behavior
- Markdown has no single universal parser behavior. CommonMark, GFM, MDX, MkDocs, GitHub rendering, static-site generators, and custom renderers differ on HTML passthrough, tables, task lists, autolinks, heading IDs, footnotes, and extension syntax.
- Parsing is block-then-inline grammar, so indentation, blank lines, fence length, list nesting, and embedded HTML can change the token tree far from the apparent edit.
- Generated documentation pipelines may preprocess templates, includes, front matter, directives, or code fences before Markdown parsing. Source text is therefore not always the final document input.

## Types, representations, and persistence
- Front matter is a separate schema surface, typically YAML/TOML/JSON, with its own type coercion and migration behavior.
- Links, anchors, paths, Unicode normalization, and percent-encoding form a persisted representation contract across files, sites, and platforms.
- Numeric-looking content should not be treated as numeric data unless a consuming tool explicitly parses it; examples containing overflow, NaN, signed width, or precision claims need executable evidence outside Markdown.

## Runtime, ecosystem, and interoperability
- Embedded HTML, Mermaid, MathJax, JSX/MDX, shortcodes, and fenced executable snippets create ABI/interop-like boundaries with other parsers and runtimes.
- Renderer libraries and plugins are part of the behavior surface. A document valid in one ecosystem can fail or render differently after a dependency upgrade.
- Large generated tables, embedded data URIs, or huge fenced logs can create performance and memory pressure in editors, CI renderers, or static-site builds.

## Failure signatures and instrumentation
- Common production symptoms include broken heading links after rename, fences swallowing following sections, tables collapsing because of pipe escaping, list numbering reset by indentation, and docs that render locally but fail on the publishing renderer.
- Instrumentation should include the actual renderer/build command, link checker, snippet extraction tests, and rendered DOM/HTML inspection where layout or anchors matter.
- A false positive is a stylistic linter complaint that the target renderer intentionally accepts; guard by qualifying against the configured renderer and extension set.

## Migration, negative-space, and learning
- Migration between Markdown engines must diff rendered structure, anchors, code blocks, front matter, and embedded HTML rather than only source text.
- Negative-space check: a documented command, option, feature, or API is not implemented merely because the Markdown says it exists.
- Learning motifs should record recurring stale-command, stale-path, broken-anchor, and docs-vs-runtime mismatches so later repo audits target them first.

# json Depth-5 Format Concerns

This pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline. It must be composed with the actual language, compiler/runtime, platform and repo authority.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- JSON has numbers, strings, booleans, null, arrays and objects only; application enums/dates/bytes/big integers need explicit encoding contracts.
- Object member order should not carry semantics unless the surrounding protocol explicitly defines it.
- Duplicate object keys are not uniformly rejected/interpreted across parsers; producers should avoid them and validators may need to reject.
- Number precision/range differs across consumers, especially JavaScript vs 64-bit integers/decimal domains.
- Missing member, member present with null and default value are distinct compatibility states.
- Unknown-field policy determines forward compatibility; strict rejection and silent ignore solve different problems.
- Unicode escaping/normalization and unpaired surrogate handling vary among libraries.
- JSON text is not a schema; validation/versioning belongs to an explicit contract.
- Comments/trailing commas/NaN/Infinity are extensions in some parsers and invalid standard JSON.
- Canonicalization matters for signatures/hashes/diffs; ordinary serializers may reorder or format differently.
- Qualification round-trips boundary numeric/text/null/missing/unknown cases through every producer/consumer implementation.

**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### number

**Mechanism:** JSON has one numeric syntax while consumers map to different integer/float widths and may lose precision.

**Detection:** inspect schema/consumer type.

**Adversarial edge:** large integer, exponent, -0.

**Qualification:** roundtrip with boundary values.

### shape

**Mechanism:** Missing vs null vs empty and unknown/duplicate properties have consumer-specific meaning.

**Detection:** define schema and strictness.

**Adversarial edge:** duplicate key, extra field, missing field.

**Qualification:** negative parse/validation tests.

### encoding

**Mechanism:** JSON text is Unicode but BOM/invalid escapes/control chars/normalization can hit parser differences.

**Detection:** fuzz parser boundary.

**Adversarial edge:** surrogate/escape/UTF-8 edge.

**Qualification:** cross-parser fixtures.

## Depth-5 rules

- Resolve exact version/configuration/consumer before universalizing behavior.
- Separate declaration/configuration/loading from actual execution and observable effect.
- Run negative-space checks for configured-but-unused, loaded-but-unconsumed and tested-but-unexercised paths.
- Preserve exact evidence tier for build, static, integration and runtime claims.
- Add repo-learned failure motifs back into this pack only when they generalize beyond one repository.


## PACK DOCUMENT: GAPS.md

# JSON Depth-5 Gap Closure

## Parser and representation semantics
- JSON syntax is small but parser policy is not: duplicate keys, BOM handling, comments/trailing commas, maximum depth, integer size, and invalid Unicode acceptance vary by library.
- Object member order is semantically insignificant in JSON itself even though downstream code may preserve or incorrectly depend on insertion order.
- Numbers have a grammar, not a universal numeric type. JavaScript Number, Python int/float, .NET numeric types, Rust serde targets, and database bindings differ on width, precision, overflow, NaN rejection, and exponent handling.
- Missing, null, empty string, zero, false, and empty collections are distinct representations. Schema/defaulting code must not silently collapse them.

## Memory, concurrency, and performance
- DOM-style parsing allocates the entire tree; streaming/SAX-style parsing changes lifetime and control flow. Large or attacker-controlled JSON can create memory pressure or deep-recursion failures.
- Shared mutable JSON DOM nodes are library-specific objects; concurrent mutation/iteration requires the host library's thread-safety guarantees, not assumptions from JSON itself.
- Serialization hot paths should measure allocation, encoding, and copy cost; pretty-printing and repeated parse/stringify cycles can dominate latency.

## Interop, libraries, and implementation-defined behavior
- JSON-to-object binding is schema/serializer behavior, not JSON behavior. Constructor selection, unknown fields, case sensitivity, enum conversion, polymorphism, dates, and reference handling are implementation-defined by the serializer.
- ABI/interop boundaries appear when JSON crosses JavaScript/native, RPC, process, database, or plugin boundaries; every side must agree on encoding and schema.
- Libraries may expose custom converters or coercion hooks that execute application code during serialization/deserialization.

## Failure signatures, migration, and guards
- Common production symptoms: large IDs rounded in JavaScript, duplicate-key data silently overwritten, enum/date format drift, casing changes breaking clients, and unknown fields disappearing during round-trip.
- Instrumentation should log schema/version and bounded parse diagnostics without dumping secrets or full private payloads.
- Migration must test old-reader/new-writer and new-reader/old-writer compatibility, preserving unknown fields where forward compatibility requires it.
- False-positive guard: textual key order, whitespace, and escaping differences are not semantic changes unless a consumer explicitly signs/compares raw bytes.
- Negative-space check: a field present in JSON is not proof any runtime path reads or enforces it.
- Learning motifs should capture recurrent coercion, precision, unknown-field, and schema-version failures.

# json-rpc Depth-5 Protocol Concerns

This protocol pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline.
Protocol correctness includes framing/schema, state, timing, authority, retries,
partial failure, library/runtime implementation, platform/network behavior,
and application semantics. A successful API call is not proof of protocol correctness.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Identity/version: JSON-RPC 2.0 must be distinguished from 1.0/custom RPC envelopes; transport is separate from protocol version.
- Parser/schema: request/response objects require jsonrpc, method, params, id/result/error rules with exact absent/null distinctions.
- Dispatch binding: method names map to executable authority; registration aliases/versioned names and namespace collisions need inventory.
- Type semantics: positional vs named params and JSON number/string/null coercion must match server method contracts.
- Evaluation/control: notifications intentionally produce no response; batches contain independent requests and may complete out of order.
- Numeric/id limits: numeric IDs can exceed JS precision; string IDs avoid some cross-runtime ambiguity.
- Lifetime: pending-call map entries, timers/cancellation and transport teardown must release on every success/error/disconnect path.
- Concurrency: response ordering is not request ordering; correlation must use id, not FIFO assumptions.
- Errors/recovery: parse error, invalid request, method not found, invalid params, internal error and transport failure are distinct evidence.
- Serialization: duplicate keys, unknown fields and custom error.data payloads require bounded parsing and schema policy.
- Security: method allowlists, parameter validation and authority separation matter because RPC exposes executable operations.
- Performance: large batch requests and expensive methods need quotas/backpressure; batch is not automatically more efficient.
- Libraries: frameworks may auto-generate IDs, convert exceptions or reject notifications/batches differently.
- Failure signatures: -32700 parse, -32600 invalid request, -32601 missing method, -32602 invalid params, -32603 internal error are diagnostic fingerprints.
- Migration: method rename/schema evolution needs compatibility aliases or explicit versioning rather than silent reinterpretation.
- Negative-space: method registration or schema generation does not prove requests reach that implementation or responses are consumed.
- False-positive guard: a missing response is correct for a notification; do not report it as timeout without confirming an id-bearing request.
- Learning motif: record recurring custom server error codes only with server/version provenance.

## Signature concern catalog

### correlation

**Mechanism:** Request id, notification/no-id, batch and error/result exclusivity define correlation semantics.

**Detection:** trace ids and pending map.

**Adversarial edge:** duplicate/out-of-order id, notification response.

**Qualification:** protocol fixture.

### errors

**Mechanism:** Transport error, JSON parse error and JSON-RPC error object are separate failure channels.

**Detection:** classify each layer.

**Adversarial edge:** invalid JSON, method-not-found, server exception.

**Qualification:** negative matrix.



## PACK DOCUMENT: FULL-COVERAGE.md

# Full Coverage Addendum
- **Build/dependencies:** JSON-RPC libraries, transport adapters and generated client/server bindings are versioned dependencies whose id/error/batch/notification behavior can differ.
- **Undefined/implementation-defined:** JSON-RPC does not define the underlying transport, reconnection, authentication, ordering across independent channels or application error schema; those behaviors belong to the selected implementation/protocol layer.

# http-rest Depth-5 Protocol Concerns

This protocol pack augments the complete HTE-Code v2 Depth-5 baseline.
Protocol correctness includes framing/schema, state, timing, authority, retries,
partial failure, library/runtime implementation, platform/network behavior,
and application semantics. A successful API call is not proof of protocol correctness.

## High-signal failure mechanics
- Identity/version: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, proxy/CDN behavior, API version, media type and auth scheme are separate compatibility axes.
- Parser/framing: Content-Length, chunked transfer, compression, trailers, header folding/normalization and body charset must be interpreted by the actual client/server stack.
- Method semantics: safety, idempotency and cacheability differ by method and endpoint contract; retry policy must not duplicate non-idempotent side effects.
- Redirect semantics: 301/302/303/307/308 differ in method/body preservation; credentials and sensitive headers must not cross authority unexpectedly.
- Status semantics: transport success, HTTP status success, schema-valid response and domain success are four distinct layers.
- Header state: Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, Cookie, Cache-Control, ETag/If-Match, Range and CORS headers materially alter behavior.
- Numeric limits: status codes, Content-Length, pagination limits, retry counts, timeout units and rate-limit counters need width/bounds checks.
- Streaming lifetime: response bodies own sockets/buffers until consumed/disposed; partial reads, abandoned streams and cancellation can exhaust pools.
- Concurrency: connection pooling, HTTP/2 multiplexing, per-host limits and shared retry/rate-limit state can produce head-of-line or stampede behavior.
- Errors/recovery: DNS, connect, TLS, timeout, reset, malformed response, 4xx, 5xx and domain errors require different retry/escalation rules.
- Serialization: JSON/XML/form/multipart encoders must match schema, content type, charset and absent/null/empty semantics.
- Security: URL construction, SSRF, header injection, request smuggling, open redirects, credential leakage, cookie scope and TLS verification are trust boundaries.
- Platform/network: proxies, IPv4/IPv6, corporate TLS interception, DNS caching, MTU and mobile network changes can alter runtime behavior.
- Libraries: wrapper defaults for redirects, decompression, cookie jars, pooling and timeout semantics vary by framework/version.
- Performance: connection reuse, streaming vs buffering, compression, pagination and retry/backoff determine latency, memory and throughput.
- Failure signatures: 400 often indicates contract/input mismatch; 401/403 authority; 404 routing/version; 409/412 concurrency/precondition; 429 throttling; 5xx server or intermediary failure.
- Migration: API/media-type/version deprecation, pagination changes and default-field additions need old/new client compatibility tests.
- Negative-space: route declared, client generated, or response parsed does not prove the intended endpoint is called or its result is consumed.
- False-positive guard: repeated GET retries or 404 handling can be correct when the endpoint contract explicitly defines them; do not label patterns without method/domain context.
- Learning motif: record recurring endpoint-specific status fingerprints, proxy quirks and retry failures only after reproduced evidence across runs.

**Role:** protocol-specific augmentation; language/runtime/toolchain packs remain additive.
**Maturity:** seeded

## Signature concern catalog

### status

**Mechanism:** HTTP transport success, application success and semantic success are distinct; redirects/retries/idempotency matter.

**Detection:** trace method/status/redirect/retry policy.

**Adversarial edge:** 3xx/4xx/5xx, timeout after server commit.

**Qualification:** mock + real endpoint failure matrix.

### headers

**Mechanism:** Content-Type, Accept, auth, cache and conditional headers change representation/authority.

**Detection:** inspect exact request/response headers without secrets.

**Adversarial edge:** missing charset, stale ETag, auth expiry.

**Qualification:** wire-level integration.

### body

**Mechanism:** Streaming/body ownership, size limits and partial reads affect memory and correctness.

**Detection:** trace buffering/stream lifetime.

**Adversarial edge:** oversized/chunked/truncated body.

**Qualification:** bounded streaming tests.

# Full Coverage Addendum
- **Undefined/implementation-defined:** 'REST' adds application conventions beyond HTTP and is not a wire standard itself. Proxy/cache retry behavior, redirect policy, connection pooling, DNS/TLS and JSON/date/error envelopes are client/server implementation choices that must be recorded explicitly.
